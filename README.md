# Requirements

In this assignment, you will produce the design of the following components of the user interface:
* The main screen for the automobile which is the default screen displayed when the car is started and the interface has not been configured in another way.
* The screen(s) for at least 2 sub-systems such as radio, navigation or heating/air conditioning.

When you do a sub-system, you should do all screens required for that sub-system. For example, if you are playing music from a Bluetooth device then you should have the screen(s) necessary to discover and pair a Bluetooth device.

You should prototype your design in a tool such as Adobe Xd or submit JPEG/PNG images of your screens if other tools are used. 

Your design should follow all of the design rules, guidelines and patterns we have studied during the course. While you can start with design ideas from one of the existing automobile systems, it is expected that you will improve upon it and demonstrate innovation. You should strive for visibility of the most important information the driver will need while making the best use of the available screen space and distracting the driver as little as possible. You should make good use of the input and output devices available to you to design the best possible interface you can.
